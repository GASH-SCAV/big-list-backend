# README

This is the backend that hosts The Big List, the list of all University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt items. It is built in Rails with a Postgresql Database.

# Setup

Ensure your environment is set up with ruby installed, rails installed, and postgresql installed and running if you would like to develop locally.

# Testing

We use rspec for our test suite. Call `rspec` to ensure all tests pass before deploying.

# Linting

We use rubocop for linting. Call `rubocop` to ensure your code matches our coding conventions. Call `rubocop -a` to correct any autocorrectable offenses.
